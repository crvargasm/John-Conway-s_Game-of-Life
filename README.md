# John Conway's - Game of Life
An implementation, in the GO programming language, of the "Game of Life" **[[Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life)]** designed by the British mathematician John Horton Conway.

In addition, you will find a folder with 3 initial provisions so that: 

1.) The game remains static. \
2.) There is a cyclical pattern. \
3.) There is (apparently) an infinite pattern.
